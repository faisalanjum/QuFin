Queries:
1. Done - How does the updated_at column gets updated in all tables like in User table?
2. Not able to use async and await as its throwing error. Did you use it as I just see async command but not await?




Update Tables:
1. Symbol: Update table once in few days (cronjob)
2. Vendors_Symbol: Updates for every symbol added/removed.

@Sundeep
1. Please give specific character lengths and types for Table Columns so as to make performance faster.
2. Create functions for code wherever possible
3. I am Naming columns and then renaming them again
    - check if there is a cleaner/better way to achieve the same end goal.
4. Make single line comments just like I did
5. Check everything under all scenarios
6. Create a list (errors_list) which includes all tickers that weren't included in our database from all vendors
7. A function to identify symbols??
8. Change Variable Names to make them smaller, descriptive, logical
9. #NEED TO UPDATE "extra_to_be_updated" in the database
10. Please check if "internal_code" column in Symbol Table is not be overwritten by 1 when its 2 or vice versa
11. Incase we want to link stocks to Indices - how can we do that?
12. Need to write code to update vendorsymbol
13. # **important -- when adding polygon's assets to company assets - Need to concatenate "final_polygon_stock" to extra_rows_df "in df_company_tbl" but its not populating when I concatenate these both
14. IMPORTANT - TO CHECK IF extra_tickers(internal_code = 2 is being added to "vendorsymbol" table?
15. In vendor_symbol table, we also need to account for all the new rows in Symbol table that we created (internal_code = 2) - our internal vendor_id is 7
